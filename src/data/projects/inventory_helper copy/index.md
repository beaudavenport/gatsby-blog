Celestial Loom V2 represents the consolidation of two previous services that made up Nikki Davenport's Astrology presence online: The original Celestial Loom site, and her wordpress blog. Netlify CMS provides the basis for an admin dashboard that allows the creation of new blog posts, services, and events, while Snipcart provides a dynamic checkout experience for customers purchasing a service or event admission.
