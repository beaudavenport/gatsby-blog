The Schnucks Rewards app is a cross-platform (iOS and Android) mobile application for the Schnucks Grocery Store's rewards program. The app also provides online ordering, store and inventory browsing, shopping list functionality, and more to allow customer to engage with Schnucks stores.

**Unique Solutions**: Our team often worked on the edge of technological capability for React Nativeâ€” at several points, fulfilling use cases for the customer required working on "native modules", small pieces of platform-specific functionality that plug into the shared React Native codebase. Through cross-functional collaboration and rapid learning, we were able to create functionality beyond the core React Native capabilities.
