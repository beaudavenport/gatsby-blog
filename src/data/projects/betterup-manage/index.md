BetterUp Manage™ combines the various modalities of BetterUp's Human Transformation Platform into a bespoke journey for managers to assess their current challenges and provide just-in-time support for wherever they may need it in their journey as a manager.

**Unique Solutions**: Incorporating disparate modalities from other parts of the BetterUp platform required that our team collaborate with many other teams and experts to compose and customize experiences into an effective new experience. As a 0-1 product, we were constantly using data and analytics to learn and improve the experience, sometimes requiring complete architectural revisions.
