Perserverance, too, seems like a necessary aspect of that effort. The outcome of both of those things for me has been: having 2 kids under 2 makes it awfully hard to keep up a blog practice. But with a new decade upon us, it's important to make the effort. We all have to start somewhere.</p>\n<h2>\"Simplify\" - a Mantra for a New Decade</h2>\n<p>This is the third incarnation of my portolio/blog site.

This has always been a personal challenge for me - I tend to <em>keep adding stuff</em>, but over the years I've learned more and more the importance of simplicity, both in design and development. It's a difficult target to shoot for, both in design and coding, but is certainly worth the effort.</p>\n<h2>Jekyll to Gatsby and the Rise of the Jamstack</h2>\n<p>My initial blog was built with <a href=\"https://jekyllrb.com/\">Jekyll</a> in 2014. Maybe it was just my professional bubble, but I felt like EVERYBODY was into Ruby at the time. I was trying to move into the world of Ruby on Rails, and spent a fair amount of time with other technologies that incorporated Ruby, including Jekyll. <a href=\"https://jamstack.org/generators/\">Static Site Generators</a> were also making a splash, with an almost nostalgic appeal to the simplicity of a website based only on static assets, where dynamic content is incorporated at \"build\" time. Plus, Jekyll working with <a href=\"https://pages.github.com/\">Github Pages</a> seemed like the perfect match for actually getting development work out there for others to see (and it's free!). These factors got me really hooked, and I eventually used Jekyll to replace my static HTML portfolio page on Github Pages AND build the first iteration of my Mom's Astrology E-Commerce site, <a href=\"https://celestialloomastrology.com/\">The Celestial Loom</a></p>\n<p>In 2016, I started using React at work and fell completely in love with it, and it's been the main channel of my development practice since. So, when I discovered <a href=\"https://www.gatsbyjs.org/\">Gatsby</a> in 2018, a static-site generator using React, I was instantly intrigued. As it turned out, an entire community and tech stack had been growing: the <a href=\"https://jamstack.org/\">Jamstack</a></p>\n<p>Explanatory Gatsby Diagram (taken from <a href=\"https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby/issues/1172#issuecomment-312694848\">Kyle Mathews' post on Github</a>):</p>\n<p><span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n      style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-width: 400px; \"\n    >\n      <a\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\"\n    href=\"/static/575ddb305545ce3bd77ddf5d5ff8b7f0/6d2da/gatsby-diagram.png\"\n    style=\"display: block\"\n    target=\"_blank\"\n    rel=\"noopener\"\n  >\n    <span\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\"\n    style=\"padding-bottom: 72%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/png;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"\n  ></span>\n  <img\n        class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\"\n        alt=\"An explanatory image of Gatsby architecture\"\n        title=\"\"\n        src=\"/static/575ddb305545ce3bd77ddf5d5ff8b7f0/e17e5/gatsby-diagram.png\"\n        srcset=\"/static/575ddb305545ce3bd77ddf5d5ff8b7f0/7e516/gatsby-diagram.png 100w,\n/static/575ddb305545ce3bd77ddf5d5ff8b7f0/772e8/gatsby-diagram.png 200w,\n/static/575ddb305545ce3bd77ddf5d5ff8b7f0/e17e5/gatsby-diagram.png 400w,\n/static/575ddb305545ce3bd77ddf5d5ff8b7f0/0a47e/gatsby-diagram.png 600w,\n/static/575ddb305545ce3bd77ddf5d5ff8b7f0/5a190/gatsby-diagram.png 800w,\n/static/575ddb305545ce3bd77ddf5d5ff8b7f0/6d2da/gatsby-diagram.png 936w\"\n        sizes=\"(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px\"\n        style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;\"\n        loading=\"lazy\"\n        decoding=\"async\"\n      />\n  </a>\n    </span></p>\n<p>I jumped right in to this new stack and ended up rebuilding <a href=\"https://celestialloomastrology.com/\">The Celestial Loom</a> using Gatsby and other Jamstack tools like <a href=\"https://www.netlify.com/\">Netlify</a> and <a href=\"https://snipcart.com/\">Snipcart</a>. After spending a good chunk of 2019 working on this effort, and after a successful relaunch, I was finally able to end the year with an update to my personal blog as well. And so here we are.</p>\n<h2>A commitment to Practice</h2>\n<p>Part of the fun of reworking a blog is riding the enthusiasm wave to make yourself actually write more posts.
